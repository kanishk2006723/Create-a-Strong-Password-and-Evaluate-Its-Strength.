# Create-a-Strong-Password-and-Evaluate-Its-Strength.
Length (L) is Most Critical: Length is the exponent in the keyspace formula, meaning increasing a password from 8 to 14+ characters exponentially increases cracking time from hours to millions of years.
Diversity (C) Matters: Including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols dramatically expands the character set (e.g., C=94 vs. C=26), defending against simple and dictionary attacks.
Avoid Common Pitfalls: Never use dictionary words, personal info , or easily guessed substitutions (e.g., changing 'a' to '@').
Attack Defense: Strong passwords force hackers to rely on slow, impractical Brute-Force Attacks , rather than fast 
Dictionary Attacks.
Best Practice: Use a long passphrase (15+ characters) with a variety of characters, or use a Password Manager to generate and store unique, highly complex passwords.
